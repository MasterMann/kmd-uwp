## Kommander is a file explorer with Fluent Design and maximum customizability 

Easily manage your files: create, rename, delete, copy, move.... 
Be more productive by our new multi-tabbed/multi-window views. 
Customize every aspect of commander to fit your needs. Change how items look, change explorer counts, configure hotkeys for all commands. 
Not enough? Kommander is open-source, implement your needs in your own.
